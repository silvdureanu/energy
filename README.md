# Frugal learning

This project contains code that trains several custom neural networks in parallel, with a range of hyperparameters, in an attempt to simulate energy-frugal learning strategies that biological neural networks might employ. The simulation outputs energy costs, as well as several other metrics. The project is started from the 'run.py' file:

```
python run.py
```

The first time the code is run, training and testing data will be downloaded and saved locally.

Dependencies: pytorch, scipy, pandas, psutil.
